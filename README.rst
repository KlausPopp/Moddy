A discrete event simulator for concept analysis written in python.
System models are written in python.

Moddy generates sequence diagram, model structure graphs, finite state machine graphs and trace tables from the simulation.


Typical applications are

	* Modelling communication protocols
	* Modelling highly distributed computer systems

For detailed information, refer to `Moddy Online Documentation <https://klauspopp.github.io/Moddy/>`.
