Moddy
======

A discrete event simulator for concept analysis written in python.

System models are written in python. The model behaviour can be event based, sequentially or a combination of both. 

Moddy generates sequence diagram, model structure graphs, finite state machine graphs and trace tables from the simulation.


Typical applications are:

* Modelling communication protocols
* Modelling highly distributed computer systems

For detailed information, refer to `Moddy Online Documentation <https://klauspopp.github.io/Moddy>`.


Moddy comes with an interactive viewer for sequence diagrams where you can dynamically adjust the time scale.
Here is a screenshot of Moddy Interactive Viewer,  
better see `Online Viewer Demo <https://klauspopp.github.io/Moddy/_static/2_sergw.html>`.
