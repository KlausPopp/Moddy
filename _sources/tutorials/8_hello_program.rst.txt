Hello Demo as a Sequential Program

Covers:

- Sequential Program Modelling

This demo shows the same behavior as :ref:`1_hello`, but uses the Moddy sequential program model.
I models how two persons, Bob and Joe, talk to eachother.

The words they are talking are the mesages.

The persons send and receive the voice at their IO-port `head`.
