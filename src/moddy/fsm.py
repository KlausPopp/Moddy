    """
    A finite state machine.
    Subclass your FSM from this class.

    Example::

        class Computer(Fsm):

            def __init__(self):

                transitions = {
                    '':
                        [('INITIAL', 'off')],
                    'off':
                        [('PowerApplied', 'standby')],
                    'standby':
                        [('PowerButtonPressed', 'normal_op')],
                    'normal_op':
                        [('PowerButtonPressed', 'standby'),
                         ('OsShutdown', 'standby')],
                    'any':
                        [('PowerRemoved', 'off')]
                }

                super().__init__( dictTransitions=transitions )

    The special *ANY* state means that the transitions can be initiated from
    ANY state.
    The special *INITIAL* event must be in the '' (uninitialized) state and
    specifies the INITIAL transistion
    which is triggered by :meth:`.start_fsm`.


    You can define entry and exit method that are executed when a state is
    entered or left.
    These methods must follow the naming convention
    ``state_<statename>_<entry/exit>``
    They don't need to exist. They are called only if they are defined.

    Note that entry and exit actions are NOT called at self transitions
    (transitions to the current state)::

        # Off actions
        def state_off_entry(self):
            print("state_off_entry")

        def state_off_exit(self):
            print("state_off_exit")

    You can also define a "do" Method that is invoked

    * after the "Entry" methode
    * at self transistions to the state

    These methods must follow the naming convention ``state_<statename>_do``


    Such routines can be also defined for the special *ANY* state.
    If they exist they are called at
    the entry or exit or self transitions to/from any state.

    .. note: You cannot define actions for transitions!

    Use the fsm as follows::

        comp = Computer()
        comp.start_fsm()    # sets the state machine to its initial state

        comp.event('PowerApplied')
        print("State %s" % comp.state)

        comp.event('PowerButtonPressed')
        print("State %s" % comp.state)

        comp.event('PowerRemoved')
        print("State %s" % comp.state)


    You can call :meth:`.exec_state_dependent_method` to execute a
    state specific method of the fsm.
    e.g. ``exec_state_dependent_method('msg', 123)`` calls
    ``state_<currentStateName>_msg( 123 )``

    (e.g. the simFsmPart uses it to execute the _msg and _expiration functions)


    **Hierarchically Nested State Support**

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine#Hierarchically_nested_states

    Rules:
    Nested states are defined by the user in the transition list:


    Main FSM::

        transitions = {
            '':
                [('INITIAL', 'off')],
            'off':
                [('PowerApplied', 'standby')],
            'standby':
                [('PowerButtonPressed', 'normal_op')],
            'normal_op':
                [
                ####### NESTED FSM ('fsm-Name', Class-Name)
                 ('fsm-name' , subfsm),
                 ('PowerButtonPressed', 'standby'),
                 ('OsShutdown', 'standby')],
            'any':
                [('PowerRemoved', 'off')]
        }

    * A nested FSM is instantiated when the upper level state is entered
    * A nested FSM cannot exit
    * A nested FSM receives all events from the upper level FSM. \
    If the event is not known in the nested FSM, \
    it is directed to the upper FSM. Events that are known in the \
    nested FSM are NOT directed to upper FSM

    * If the upper state exits, the exit action of the current states \
    (first, the state in the nested fsm, \
    then the upper fsm) are called. Then the nested fsm is terminated.

    * Orthogonal nested states are also supported. Meaning, multiple \
    nested fsms exist in parallel. Just \
    enter multiple subFsms in the transition list of a state.

    * For nested statemachines, the following methods are usefull:

        - :meth:`.top_fsm` gives you the reference to the top level Fsm. \
        E.g. to fire an event to the top Fsm.
        - :meth:`moddy_part` gives you the moddy part where the state machine \
        is contained, regardless of the fsm nesting level
